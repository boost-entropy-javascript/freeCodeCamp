# --explanation--

`Web` means "world wide web", referring to websites and online applications. `开发者 (kāi fā zhě)` means "developer" or "creator". Together, `Web 开发者 (kāi fā zhě)` means a profession that focuses on building and maintaining websites or web applications. For example:

`我是 Web 开发者。(wǒ shì Web kāi fā zhě.)` – I am a web developer.
