### --feedback--

This word means "name".

# --explanation--

`名字 (míng zi)` means "name". It generally refers to a person's full name, including both the family name (surname) and the given name (first name). For example:

`我的名字是刘明。(wǒ de míng zi shì Liu Ming.)` - My name is Liu Ming.

​In specific contexts, `名字 (míng zi)` can refer only to the given name.​​ This happens when it is contrasted with `姓 (xìng)` (surname), such as on a form with separate fields for `姓 (xìng)` and `名字 (míng zi)`.
