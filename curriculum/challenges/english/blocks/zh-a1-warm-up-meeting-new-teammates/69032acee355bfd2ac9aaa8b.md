## Tone Sandhi of `不 (bù)`

`不 (bù)` means "no" or "not". When it is followed by a syllable which is in the first, second or the third tone, it remains in the fourth tone.

However, when `不 (bù)` is followed by a syllable which is in the fourth tone, it changes to the second tone.

This tone change is a natural adjustment in speech to make pronunciation smoother.
